## Overview

Gnosis Pay is a non-custodial service that allows users to pay directly from their wallets using a Visa card. Gnosis Pay is built on top of Safe{Wallet} and includes a delay module that guarantees the merchants will have their funds available after a payment was made with the card.

However, this mechanism adds some limitations for the Safe, so it's not possible to operate the balances of the account without the delay module. This means that the Safe can't be used for other purposes while the delay module is active.
